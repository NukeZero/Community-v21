## 🚀 Flyff Community v21 Source Project
We're thrilled to announce the launch of our new **Flyff source** on GitHub! This project is being built with a strong focus on community, quality, and giving back to the game we all love.

## ℹ️ Why This Project?
This Flyff source is the **flagship open-source release** of the **NukeZero** development collective. We are a team committed to supporting development across multiple classic games, and we believe the best work happens collaboratively.

For those who remember the past: **Our staff** are the same developers who evolved the original **Lodelight** project into **NukeZero**. This new open-source initiative is a **direct extension of that lineage**, bringing the lessons and passion from those projects into this new, community-driven era.

## 💻 Technologies Used
This project relies on the following core technologies. We encourage contributors to familiarize themselves with these platforms.

## 🤝 Contributions: Get Involved!
This isn't just our project-it's yours! Community contributions will be the **backbone** of this source.

We are building a comprehensive system on our upcoming website to manage all **code submissions** and bug reports. **The website must be complete before we can formally accept contributions or bug reports, but we will eventually open up this GitHub repository for direct code submissions and Issues.**

The best way you can help right now is by showing your support:

  * **Stargazing:** Give the repository a **star** to help us build visibility and community momentum!

We rely on the expertise and passion of the community, and we look forward to integrating your feedback and code once our full infrastructure is ready.

**Together, we'll build the best Flyff source and the next generation of classic game development.**

## 🌐 The Website & Community Hub (Coming Soon)
Our dedicated project **website** is being built to serve the entire NukeZero community, covering all the games we support.

The site will be the central hub for our efforts, offering:
  * **Information & Documentation:** Detailed guides on compiling, setting up, customizing the source, and a deep-dive into the core architecture.
  * **Releases:** Official download links and notes for stable source releases, patches, and updates.
  * **Roadmaps:** See what features and fixes we're currently prioritizing across projects.
  * **Contribution Hub:** The main platform for submitting and tracking all community code contributions and bug reports.

We will update this repository with the link to the website as soon as it goes live!
